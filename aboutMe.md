			<h2>Achievements</h2>
		</header>
		<p>YOU must be the change you wish to see, so I choose to lead by
		example.</p>
		<p>By the end of my first year at UCSB, I was the Director of Outreach for Data Science UCSB, Vice President for Indus, and Finance Executive for UCSB Dhadkan. It was through Indus that I was able to establish life-long friendships amongst strangers my freshman year of college. In my final year, I hope to recreate this experience for all members of our community as the President of Indus.</p>
		<p>I pride myself on my ability to remain persistent and proactive in the face of challenge. Interning for the People Analytics team at NASA has taught me that even the smallest initiatives– such as independently figuring out how to embed an LLM-based chat widget in our team's knowledge base site– can lead us closer to success. Leadership comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>

					<h3>Future Goals</h3>

				<p>After getting a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, I plan on working in the field for a year or two before pursuing an M.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or another related field.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I love singing along to music from artists such as The Beatles and Billie Eilish. My favorite places to hike and explore nature are  Pinnacles National Park in California and the beaches along the coast of Isla Vista– just outside UCSB campus.</p>
