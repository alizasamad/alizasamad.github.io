Hi! My name is Aliza Samad, and I am starting my second year at the University of California, Santa Barbara looking for internships in either Data Analytics or Product Management. My current qualifications include proficiency in statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, intermediate knowledge of SQL and R, and some experience with Python and Tableau.

Feel free to contact me at alizasamad@ucsb.edu!
