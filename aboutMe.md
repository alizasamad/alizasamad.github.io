			<h2>Achievements</h2>
		</header>
		<p>YOU must be the change you wish to see to see change, so I choose to lead by example. In fact, by the end of my first year of college, I earned the position of Director of Outreach for Data Science UCSB. Data Science UCSB is a club dedicated to helping students acquire the skills needed to be successful in the data science field, which are then showcased through our annual project showcase. My role is to guide students professionally by helping them build their LinkedIn profiles and resumes and connect them to a professional network of company representatives from Microsoft, Liberty Mutual, Amgen, and more that I helped expand over the last year. In this position, communication is key.

But, data science is only half of who I am. I am a community-builder at heart. That is why I am UCSB Indus' Co-Vice President this year. Indus is UCSB's largest South Asian organization. Our goal is to create a welcoming environment for students with a South Asian background while teaching the rest of our student population about the diversity of South Asian traditions. As Co-VP, my responsibilities include: managing the year's event calendar, persuading the school to allot funds for events, and ensuring the board runs as smoothly as a well-oiled machine. 

Finally, I am taking this summer to explore the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning. I will blog my progress and upload projects as often as I can. So far, I have started to play around with the Titanic dataset on Kaggle (expect a finished product soon!). My skills already include intermediate knowledge of Python, R, and SQL, as well as certain data visualization tools such as Tableau.

					<h3>Future Goals</h3>
				</header>
				<p>After getting a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, I plan on working in the field for a year or two before pursuing my MBA. My combined interests in business and data analytics make product management in the data analytics field the perfect career path for me! With politics and business being so closely related, my ultimate goal is to one day achieve a position on the company board so that I can be the change I want to seeâ€” starting with fair and equal treatment of all genders in the workplace.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies!</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I love listening to music from artists such as The Beatles, Billie Eilish, and Arjit Singh. I am also teaching myself how to play Haley Heynderickx's song, "The Bug Collector," on the guitar. Some of my other hobbies include hiking and exploring nature. My favorite places to hike are Muir Woods and Pinnacles National Park. However, my favorite pastime has to be spending quality time with family and friends. My best memories are of my family playing badminton in our backyard in the cool, summer evenings!</p>
